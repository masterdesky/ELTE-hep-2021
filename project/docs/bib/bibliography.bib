  abstract      = {The anisotropy parameter v_2, the second harmonic of the azimuthal particles distribution, has been measured with the PHENIX detector in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV for identified and inclusive charged particles at central rapidities (|eta| < 0.35) with respect to the reaction plane defined at high rapidities (|eta| = 3-4). The v_2 for all particles reaches a maximum at mid-centrality, and increases with p_T up to 2 GeV/c and then saturates or decreases slightly. Our results depart from hydrodynamically predicted behavior above 2 GeV/c. A quark coalescence model is also investigated.},

  abstract      = {Measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy of high-\pT neutral pion neutral pion production in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV by the PHENIX experiment are presented. The data included in this paper were collected during the 2004 RHIC running period and represent approximately an order of magnitude increase in the number of analyzed events relative to previously published results. Azimuthal angle distributions of pi^0s detected in the PHENIX electromagnetic calorimeters are measured relative to the reaction plane determined event-by-event using the forward and backward beam-beam counters. Amplitudes of the second Fourier component (v_2) of the angular distributions are presented as a function of pi^0 transverse momentum p_T for different bins in collision centrality. Measured reaction plane dependent pi^0 yields are used to determine the azimuthal dependence of the pi^0 suppression as a function of p_T, R_AA (Delta phi,p_T). A jet-quenching motivated geometric analysis is presented that attempts to simultaneously describe the centrality dependence and reaction plane angle dependence of the pi^0 suppression in terms of the path lengths of hypothetical parent partons in the medium. This set of results allows for a detailed examination of the influence of geometry in the collision region, and of the interplay between collective flow and jet-quenching effects along the azimuthal axis.},
