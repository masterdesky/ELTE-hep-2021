One of the main focus of heavy ion research is the study of the flow anisotropies in large energy collisions -- most prominently in Au$+$Au events at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\ \mathrm{GeV}/\mathrm{c}$. I've measured the $p_{T}$ traverse momentum dependence of the $v_{2}$ flow anisotropy coefficient using real, but simplified observational data from ultrarelativistic heavy ion experiments. At the end I've obtained similar results to those in the literature and showed that $v_{2}$ value saturates at $p_{T} \approx 2\ \mathrm{GeV}/\mathrm{c}$ with an approximate value around $v_{2} \approx 0.3$.
